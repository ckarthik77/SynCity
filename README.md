## ðŸš€ GitHub Repository Pipeline

Hereâ€™s a recommended structure & workflow for setting up your SynCity project repo:

### 1. Repository Structure

```
SynCity/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                     # Documentation, diagrams, pitch deck
â”œâ”€â”€ datasets/                 # Collected CSV/JSON traffic data
â”œâ”€â”€ simulator/                # SUMO/CARLA configs, road networks, routes
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ sumo/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ carla/
â”œâ”€â”€ controller/               # Cloud traffic management logic
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/                  # Flask/FastAPI endpoints for V2I comms
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ rules_engine/         # Dynamic signal control, routing logic
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ models/               # ML models for congestion prediction
â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/                # React.js or Dash visualization UI
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                  # Utility scripts (data logging, dataset cleaning)
â”œâ”€â”€ tests/                    # Unit/integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json              # Frontend dependencies
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md                 # Project overview, setup guide
â””â”€â”€ LICENSE                   # License file
```

### 2. GitHub Actions (CI/CD Pipeline)

#### Workflow: `.github/workflows/syncity.yml`

```yaml
name: SynCity CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
      uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Set up Python
      uses: actions/setup-python@v4
      with:
        python-version: '3.10'

    - name: Install Backend Dependencies
      run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt

    - name: Run Backend Tests
      run: |
        pytest tests/

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'

    - name: Install Frontend Dependencies
      run: |
        cd dashboard
        npm install

    - name: Build Frontend
      run: |
        cd dashboard
        npm run build

    - name: Archive Production Build
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: dashboard-build
        path: dashboard/build
```

### 3. Contribution Workflow

1. **Fork & Clone** repo
2. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>`
3. Add code, commit with clear messages
4. Push branch & open Pull Request
5. GitHub Actions auto-tests build & backend
6. Maintainer reviews and merges

---

### 4. README.md Outline

* Project Title + Logo
* Abstract / Elevator Pitch
* Features
* System Architecture Diagram
* Tech Stack
* Setup Instructions
* Usage Guide (Run simulation, launch controller, start dashboard)
* Demo Screenshots / GIFs
* Contribution Guidelines
* License
